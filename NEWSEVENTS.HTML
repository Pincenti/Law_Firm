                            <p><strong>The Aviary Attorney!</strong></p>
                            <p> Jayjay Falcon's family has a long history of birds attending law school. However, due to the falcon's lifespan of only 12 years, Jayjay's kin never lived long enough to get through law school. Thanks to the miraculous outcome of <cite>Mueller & Tegtmeyer v. The State of Florida</cite>, birds are permitted a crash course in bird law, completed in half the time, giving birds everywhere the chance to become a lawyer for maybe a year tops. Jayjay was a top tier lawyer full of wit and ingenuity, but has since been let go due to the legal complications of having a bird as an employee. </p>

                            <p> After a 3 month hearing, the Supreme Court of Florida determined Thursday morning that requiring more years of school than a bird is even alive for was deemed "unfair." When asked for a comment, Judge Lattson said, "Mueller and Tegtmeyer have exposed every loophole in the legal system to get that ****** bird a degree. Why? I don't know, but we're thankful that we can now make the proper amendments to make sure something like this never happens again... and that they'll stop leaving me voicemails every night." </p>

                            <p><strong></strong></p>
                            <p> Tom the turkey was a local legend in Chilmark, Massachusetts, a little town on Martha’s Vineyard. His tragic tale begins
                            in 2006, when young orphan Tom was injured by a hawk. Fortunately, he was saved by a loving couple, Jonathan and Linda
                            Haar. Though they never adopted Tom as a pet, they healed his wounds and fed him regularly. Soon, Tom was hanging around
                            their house all the time, and the couple fell in love with this ugly bird.</p>
                            
                            <p>The rest of the neighbors hated Tom’s guts, probably because he was the scariest turkey in history. He regularly
                            attacked other people, and like Cujo with a comb, he’d trap people in their cars and circle their vehicles, daring his
                            victims to step out. Even worse, sometimes he’d whip up a mad turkey mob and attack unsuspecting people while his gang
                            crowded around.</p>
                            
                            <p>Terrified neighbors parked close to their front doors so they could make a quick dash to safety. Some carried brooms or
                            bats when they went outside. No one was safe from the terrible Tom, except Jonathan and Linda, who didn’t know how foul
                            their fowl had become.</p>
                            
                            <p>Things came to a head when a deliverywoman called the cops, complaining that a wild turkey was menacing the streets.
                            When two officers arrived, Tom wasn’t intimidated. Instead, he attacked the cops, forcing one of the officers to jump on
                            his car. The second officer pulled out his pistol and fired twice, wounding the turkey. Tom dashed off, and the police
                            chased after him, guns blazing. Tom was finally dead.</p>
                            
                            <p>Jonathan ran up, screaming and shouting. He’d loved that bird. In fact, he was so angry that he slugged one of the cops
                            in the face. Jonathan was hauled into jail, and the story became a big-time scandal. People who didn’t live in Tom’s
                            territory wrote to the newspapers, complaining about the cop’s excessive use of force. One paper ran a cartoon of a
                            stupid-looking turkey dressed up as a police officer. For weeks, it’s all anyone talked about.</p>
                            <p>                            
                            Not much happens in Chilmark, Massachusetts.</p>
                            
                            <p>Six months, $30,000 in legal fees, and several dropped charges later, Jonathan was finally released . . . and so was
                            Tom. The police had kept his bullet-ridden body in a freezer as evidence, so Tom was probably coated with frost.
                            Brokenhearted, Jonathan and Linda buried Tom in their yard, complete with a tombstone that read: “Tom the Turkey. He
                            died as he lived.”
